## Overview

This document describes a “Wordle” game development in order to participate in a full cycle of web development.

The project was structured to support and guide our web development study path.

### Wordle Game

Wordle is a Bull & Cows style word game. The user is required to guess a randomly selected word in N turns. The
application gets each guess as input and provides clues for the next guess.

An example to a “Wordle” game:

* [Hebrew version - Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.co.il/riddles/ty-page/haaretz-wordle)
* [English version - NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

## Requirements

    We use user stories to describe our application requirements. Each user story contains a list of tasks required to complete it.
    There are several ways to write user stories. I chose a template that describes the product from the point of view of a user who tries to use the application.
